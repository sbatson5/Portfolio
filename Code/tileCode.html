          <p class="lead">I have a lot of experience with Windows Servers and IIS.  With the latest release of IIS, Windows
          provided a default splash image.  As I was just learning about CCS3 animations, I thought it would be great to
          mock it up using div's and moving them with animations.  Working with squares was really easy since I could
          set the height and width and place them easily.</p>

          <p class="lead">Since the image was premade, it was easy for me to grab the colors.  For the boxes, I made the larger
          ones 100px by 100px and the smaller ones 50px by 50px.  This made my job really easy when placing them.  Once I had
          them in the right places, I decided to make a tile matching game.  This meant removing the text and adding
          some JavaScript to keep score.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Making a game: <span class="text-muted">Writing the HTML</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">To make a matching game, you need images.  There will be several pairs of images and you
          simply find the pairs to get points.  I went through each div and added an image and then created a div
          on top for a scoreboard.  The scoreboard would update with JavaScript (which I will cover below) and the divs
          would move with CSS3 animations.</p>
          <p class="lead">I add some custom classes so that I can better edit the items in CSS.  The scoreboard has
          a class of "points" for the background and "score" and "strikes" so that I can show how points increase
          and decrease.  Each div has to have its own unique identifier since I need to animate each separately.</p>
          	<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;div class="scoreBoard"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Your score: &lt;span class="points score"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Styling the game: <span class="text-muted">CSS3 to control the boxes</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Here, I set up some basic CSS to control the Header and boxes.  Since the boxes all have the same
          sizes and will have the same animation timings, there's no need to write them separately.  I also have three shades which
          I have labeled as dark, light and lighter.  I give all of them fixed positions and make them 100x100.  I give the animations
          a 5 second delay and have the animations run for 2 seconds (this was just trial and error and finding what I liked).</p>
          <p class="lead">The header image is static and won't move.  To make sure it doesn't blend into some of the boxes
          I give it a box-shadow.  This just makes it look a bit better.  The smaller boxes should be half the size of the others
          but they will have the same animations.  So, the '.small' CSS properties  just overwrite the box sizes.</p>
          <p class="lead">Due to the differences in browsers, I have to set animations for the webkit and others.  That means
          each animation needs to be written twice.  Unlike other browser differences, this one isn't too difficult and the rules
          work the same between IE and Chrome/Firefox.</p>

          <p class="lead">Writing the animations wasn't too tough but it was time consuming.  I wanted each box to move 
          in one direction only (either vertically or horizontally) but not both.  That just makes it cleaner.  Since 
          the boxes are 50x50 and 100x100, moving them is pretty clean.  I took one box at a time to make sure that 
          two boxes of the same color never end up side by side.  Since there are no borders, having the boxes touch 
          would be confusing for the player.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Making it a game: <span class="text-muted">using jQuery to keep score</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">There are a few things that need to happen before we can make it a game.  First, we want all of the images
          to disappear.  Luckily, jQuery makes it easy for us as we can fade out anythng with a class of 'tileImage.'  We delay it by 4 
          seconds (4000 milliseconds) and since the animations start at 5 seconds, we get one second before the boxes start moving.</p>
          <p class="lead">I also have some elements that I want hidden.  First is the 'floatingScore.'  This will be a quick +1 that 
          appears on the scoreboard when you make a correct selection.  Similarly, 'floatingStrike' shows when you get a strike (we will 
          allow 3 before you lose) and 'floatingWrong' will show when you lose a point.  We also want to track the person's current selection, 
          how many you have selected wrong, which choice you have (i.e. is this your first choice?), the score and what you had for your
          previous selection.</p>

var choice = 1;
var wrong = 0;
var score = 0;

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">How the game starts: <span class="text-muted">What happens when you click?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Now, we need to control what happens when someone clicks on a square.  The first thing that we need 
          to do is keep the player from clicking the same square again.  So, I add a class to that square called 'unclickable.'
          This class has no styling or special properties, but the script will only account it does not have a class of 
          'unclickable.'</p>
          <p class="lead">The next thing we do is see which choice we are on.  If it's our first choice, set choice to 2.
          Next, we need to find the image.  Since these are simple div's, we can just find the first child. We 
          set our variable 'selection' to be the name of the image (which is the 'src' of that element). We also assign 
          our variable of 'previous' to the div's first child, that way next turn, we can remember our previous selection.</p>

          <p class="lead">If it is our second selection we need to see if our selection this time matches our selection last time.  
          So, if our variable 'selection' is the same as the first child of this div, then we have a match.  We can increment the score 
          and then show our floating score (which will be explained below).  If it is not the right selection, we will hide the image again, 
          hide the previous image again, and remove the 'unclickable' class from this div and the last.  We also will decrement the score and 
          increment how many have been wrong. Similary, we will show some more floating text.</p>

          the positions of the score and strikes on the scoreboard.  Then, we set the position of the floating strike, score, 
          and wrong text to be slightly off so it doesn't go over our default numbers.</p>
          <p class="lead">These items are hidden by default, so we write a function that makes them appear.  This function 
          is called whenever there is a change in the score.  We accept an element as a parameter, that way this can be used 
          for all of the floating items.  This simply makes the element appear for half a second.  We are left with some nice floating

          ends we can show it with jQuery.  We also want to make sure the person can't keep playing, so we make every 
          div 'unclickable.'  I also want the game to be greyed out, so I change the opacity of every child of the body

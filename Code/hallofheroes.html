          often do is track our games through a private forum.  However, we wanted to add a bit more circumstance to it, so I decided to use the 
          GiantBomb API to allow us to track and record the games we played and display it in a grid format.</p>

          <p class="lead">GiantBomb provides the information in both XML and JSON formats (I have working examples with both). I chose to focus
          on JSON for speed purposes (although due to my server situation, speed is a big bottleneck).  First need get the contents and parse into 
          a json format (which PHP does very easily for us, luckily.</p>
          <p class="lead">Once we have done that, we want to then create an unordered list with our first 5 findings. This unordered list will be loaded 
          with AJAX on the main page and appear right under the search bar, giving us a live list.  Luckily, GiantBomb does a lot of the heavy lifting with 
          the search algorithm, so I only had to worry about displaying the results.</p>

          <p class="lead">The next step was to load the search results. The main page has a text input that will be used to search for the 
          results.  I used jquery and AJAX in order to load the items.  However, I found that if the user typed too fast, the results would never
          load correctly.  Instead, I had to add a delay that would reset every time a new key was hit on the keyboard.  This gave a small delay in 
          search results, but ultimately lead to accurate search results (at least as accurate as possible given the API).</p>

          However, I didn't want to force people to register, so I had my script check to see if a session was started (i.e. are they logged in?) and if not,

          the CSS and JS). On this project, a lot of languages are combined to create a site that I drafted from scratch.  We use an outside API, JSON, XML,
          PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL and AJAX.  Overall it was a fun project where I had to pass information from a lot of different formats 
          (we started with JSON, parse into PHP, load with AJAX, then either use PHP to insert it into a MySQL Database, or use JavaScript to write to 
          localstorage, then query in those two formats to write it to HTML, only to again use JavaScript to push the information to PHP via a Get request, write 
          HTML again and use AJAX to load it).  It's a long trip.</p>

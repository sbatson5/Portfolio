          With the growing demand in AngularJS, I thought it would be great to build my portfolio on it.  The site is dynamic, loading not only all of 
          examples from JSON, but loading different views depending on what you are trying to see.  This project took me less than a day to complete 
          (granted that some of the write ups had already been done).</p>

          didn't take very long to build.  The first thing I wanted for each was a unique ID--this could be anything, but I would need it later to 
          use with my Views.  I included a description of the project, a link, an image URL, and a number I would use for tracking in an array later
          (although this wasn't added until later in the project).</p>

          use the same functions from our service to pull the project, but now we want to specify what the 'activePage' is based on the 'exampleInt' I

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Scrap Street Journal: <span class="text-muted">Community blog</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I run a community blog with a few of my friends where we talk about Video Games, Movies, Comics, and TV.  It is mostly a casual
          project but we did want to give it a somewhat professional feel.  We wanted to use a pre-existing template but make it our own without too much 
          legwork.  The limitation was that we were hosting on Wordpress.com (I didn't want to pay hosting costs for another site) and could therefore
          only <i>add</i> my own CSS--I couldn't write any JavaScript nor could I edit the existing CSS that was already there.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Editing our grid: <span class="text-muted">Making the first few posts stand out</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The first thing I wanted to do was make the first 4 posts take up 50% of the page each.  The Grid theme we were using had 
          everything at 33.3333% so that they fit nicely 3 wide on each row.  To overwrite this, I need to write a style that only applied to the first 4
          articles and not all of them.  The default style cleared to the left, and we need to remove that rule, otherwise we would get breaks when we didn't 
          want them.</p>

#main article:nth-of-type(-n+4) {

#main article {

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Effects on all pages: <span class="text-muted">Compensating for these changes</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Now this change looked great on the main page.  I even added some margins to the 3rd and 4th items to get some whitespace.  
          However, all pages use the same CSS file--which meant that if you loaded up an article, it would only be 50% wide because it was technically 
          one of the first 4 articles on the page.  So, I needed to write a rule that allowed the first 4 to be 50% but not the one on the actual blog posts.
          My first thought was to make it only apply to the last article listed (afterall, there was only 1 listed on the posts).  This fixed the posts, but then
          the main page had spacing issues because the last item in the grid would always be 100%.  So, I wrote another rule to state that if it is the last 
          article and it has an article preceeding it, then switch it back to 33.3333%.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Editing the menu: <span class="text-muted">Rewriting the sidebar styles</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The next challenge was dealing with the menu bar.  The default menu would take up the entire page when you clicked on it and 
          (worst of all) it would hide all the other content by setting the display to "none."  First, I specify that the 'main' element has a display
          of 'block' and set it to "!important" so that this rule won't be overwritten (as it is since they use JS to write the style in-line).  </p>
          <p class="lead">Next, I began to rewrite the styles of the sidebar.  I wanted it to appear in the upper right corner, have a slight shadow to add
          depth and edit the font sizes so that it looked more like a menu and less like a whole page.  Ultimately, I found a happy ground, without having
          to completely rewrite it from scratch.</p>

          <p class="lead">Everytime I would add a style, it would affect something I hadn't thought of and I would have to rework my CSS.  This led to 
          a lot more custome styling than I had thought.  Rather than going through each rule I added, I thought I would post all of the CSS.  This should
          show my thought process and how the page came to be.  All of my custom rules had to be rewritten with the media queries as they would often not look
          right when I resized.  You can vist the site at <a href="http://scrapstreetjournal.com">ScrapStreetJournal.com</a> and see these styles firsthand.</p>

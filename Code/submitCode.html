          <p class="lead">An HTML survey created by Snap typically emails the data back to the user.  The data is an unusual format, which Snap uses to import data into the
           	Snap System.  The data is typically laid out in order, with each V variable representing a question and meta information about the survey such as the build of the
            software, the name of the survey, return email address and more.</p>
            <p class="lead">Without the data laid out like, Snap will not know how to import and map the data correctly to each question in the survey.  The old script worked
             fine and allowed you to import from your inbox.  However, we had a customer where this wasn't a solution and they could not go with our other cloud based 
             solution.  To work around this, I sought out to create a site that would store the data for them and format it in a way that Snap could import it.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Saving the data: <span class="text-muted">Storing it in a database</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Each survey submits the data through POST.  Normally, it goes to our script but the user can specify any script location in case they want to host
           everything on their system.  My goal was to create a site where they could manage users, each user would have their own script location and could download and
           delete their own data.  There are many tricky aspects to this but the first (and most obvious) hurdle was getting the data into a meaningful format.  What made
           this tough is that we had no idea how long each survey would be or how many questions would be in each survey.  So, we needed a script that could scale to any
           size survey.  Next, we needed a script that would write the data in the way Snap wanted (like the text file above).  To do that, the first step was to save the
           data into a database.  Each database would have one table for each survey, that way the data wouldn't get mixed together.  To do that, I would need to create a
           database table if one didn't exist already.</p>
          <p class="lead">The name of the survey is passed in as :SURVEY:.  Since this can accept special characters, I need to escape teh string and use a regular expression
           to remove special characters and replace them with underscores.  Next, I ran a query to see if there was a table already with that name.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
require_once('db_connect.php');
$survey = $_POST[':SURVEY:'];
$survey = mysqli_real_escape_string($link,preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]/i','_',$survey));
$count = "SHOW TABLES LIKE '".$survey."';";

          <p class="lead">Then, we need to see if the table exists or not.  This can be done by seeing if our query (called $count) returns any rows.  If it doesn't we will create a table with the name of $survey.  However, I need to create each field appropriately--since most of the data is text, I can safely default to a text data type.  This also works because we aren't querying these database directly, simply saving them to a text file later (so data type isn't overly important).  Still, to save on space, we create some as Decimal.  I create a boolean called $decimal_check that simply checks to see if there is a '.' in the value being submitted.  If there is and that value is a number, then we can call it a Decimal field.  Otherwise, we will call it text.  We finally append the key for the submission to our running variable of $fields with the $type we want to apply.  That way we can add it to our query (i.e. so it will say "comments text(9999), quantity Decimal(11,2)").  Since some of the fields include a colon in the field name, I replace the colon with 'xxxx.'  This is done so that I can easily switch it back to a colon when I need to create my text file.</p>

          <p class="lead">That takes care of creating the table, but what if the table already exists?  Assumedly, we should just skip to the step where we add the data in.  Unfortunately, that won't quite work because people may have edited the survey--i.e. we might have new questions on a survey and our database needs to adapt appropriately.  So, how do we handle this?  First we tell the database to show us all of the columns.  Then, we fetch each row, creating an array where each item is the name of one of our columns.  We then create one long variable, separated by spaces with the name of each column, that way we can check the name of each variable currently being submitted.</p>

          <p class="lead">So, now we have taken care of creating our table and taken care of adapting to changes to our table.  We can start working adding data to our table.  However, there is one small issue.  The Snap file expects multi-response data to be separated by commas but Post requests pass each submission in separetely.  (i.e. we want it to say V1=1;2;3 but the web page will pass it in as V1=1&V1=2&V1=3).  So, we need to write a function that will format this for us.  We will explode this stream by the & sign and then again by the = sign.  We then add our new values to an array, separating each with a semicolon.  Then finally, we use this function to format all of our responses.</p>

Then, write our query with the fields and values property and execute it.</p>

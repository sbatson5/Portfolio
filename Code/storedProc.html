          <p class="lead">A manufacturer had a pretty basic database that stored information on their customers, products, sales reps,
          offices and orders.  This worked for some basic queries and reporting, however we needed to create a system that handled reorders when 
          the quantity on hand ran too low and a way to print shipping labels.  All of the code I ran was written directly in the console.  No programs 
          were used to write these queries for me.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Creating our new tables: <span class="text-muted">Storing the info we need</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The first step was to create new tables.  We needed to create a table for reorders.  It would have a 
          manufacturer ID, Product ID, description, price for the product, and the quantity needed.</p>
          <p class="lead">Then we needed to create a table for the labels.  This table should update when we have an order and 
          simply lists the information we need on a shipping label: The order number (unique), the date for the order, name of the company 
          description and the quantity we need.</p>

create table Reorder

Product_ID Char(5) Not Null,
Description varchar(20) Not Null,

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Stored Procedure: <span class="text-muted">Handling reorders</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Now, we needed to create a stored procedure to check the quantity on hand when we received an order.  If 
          there was enough of hand, then it needs to update the quantity (which was a manual process before) and insert info for a shipping 
          label.  If there wasn't enough of hand the procedure needed to add it to the reorder list (which meant checking to make sure there 
          wasn't already a request to reorder).  If there was already a request, it needs to increase the quantity needed.</p>
          <p class="lead">To start our stored procedure, we first have to change our delimiter (since we need to use the semicolon in our 
          procedure.  We then need to declare all of the variables we will use.  These were added as I went along, but if you mapped it out 
          ahead of time, you should be able to identify the variables needed.</p>

          <p class="lead">In stored procedures, you constantly need to reference data in tables, but it doesn't make sense to constantly 
          write out select queries everytime you need a value.  So, we first started by declaring the variables and then populated them with 
          queries.  We pull in the quantities for an order, the products and more as we need all of that information for our reorders.</p>

          <p class="lead">Now that we have all of the information stored, we can finally check to see if we need to order more.  
          First, we check to see if the quantity in our order is less than or equal to the quantity on hand.  If it is, then we need 
          to simply update our Products table by decreasing the quantity on hand by the amount in our order for that particular product.  
          We then create insert the information for our shipping label.</p>
          <p class="lead">If we do not have enough on hand, then we need to reorder.  First, we check to see if that item is already in 
          our reorder table.  That information is stored in our 'pcnt' variable as it stores the number of times a product appears.  If it is 
          less than 1 (i.e. it wasn't found in our reorder table) then we need to insert this item into the table with the number that we need to 
          fulfill the order.  If it was already in the table, then we simply update the number we need to include this order as well.</p>
          <p class="lead">Finally, we end our if conditions and change our Delimiter back to the semicolon so we can continue to run normal queries.</p>

          new order.  Not only does this take care of creating a label, but it lets us know when have to place a reorder for a particular product.</p>
